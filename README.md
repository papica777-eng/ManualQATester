## 🚀 Next Steps & Automation Roadmap

While this portfolio focuses on **manual testing mastery**, I'm actively developing automation skills:

**Current Focus:**
- Python fundamentals and scripting
- Selenium WebDriver for UI automation
- API testing automation with Python + Requests
- CI/CD integration basics

**Future Goals:**
- Build Python + Selenium framework
- Implement Page Object Model (POM)
- API automation with Pytest
- Contribute to test automation projects

**Why Manual First:**
- Strong manual testing foundation is critical for effective automation
- Understanding "what to automate" requires manual testing expertise
- Manual exploratory testing finds bugs automation misses
- This portfolio proves I can think like a QA, not just execute scripts
